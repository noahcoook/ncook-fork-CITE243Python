One ADJECTIVE morning, I woke up and looked out the NOUN.  
The sky was ADJECTIVE, and I could hear a NOUN VERBing outside.  
I decided to VERB out of bed and put on my ADJECTIVE shoes.  
Then I grabbed my NOUN and headed to the NOUN down the street.  

At the NOUN, I saw a group of ADJECTIVE NOUNs who liked to VERB together.  
They were so ADJECTIVE that I couldn’t help but VERB along.  
Suddenly, a NOUN rolled by and VERBed right into a NOUN!  
Everyone gasped in ADJECTIVE surprise, but soon started to VERB again.  

By the time I got home, the NOUN was glowing ADJECTIVE in the sky.  
I sat down with my NOUN, feeling ADJECTIVE, and decided to VERB about the whole adventure.
